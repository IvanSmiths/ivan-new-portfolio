## What is Open Graph

In a nutshell: Open Graph is an internet protocol developed by Meta that enable websites to have a nicer look when shared on social media.

## Open Graph with the App router

The app router differentiate massively from the pages router. One of the removed feature is the Head component,
something that used to look like this:

``` tsx
import Head from 'next/head'

function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>My page title</title>
      </Head>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default IndexPage
```
