## What is Open Graph

In a nutshell: Open Graph is an internet protocol developed by Meta that allows websites to provide additional information specifically for social
media sharing. This information controls how your webpage is displayed in social media previews, including the title, description, and thumbnail image (can also have playable videos).
When your website is shared on social media, it will make it look like this:

<img alt="open graph example" height="932" src="/blog/add-open-graph-twitter-nextjs-app-router/open-graph-example.png" width="1280"/>

## Open Graph with the App router

### The old approach

The `app` router differentiate massively from the `pages` router. One of the removed feature is the `Head` component,
something that used to look like this:

``` tsx
import Head from 'next/head'

function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>My page title</title>
      </Head>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default IndexPage
```

There you would add manually every single metadata, from height and weight of images, to every other property.

### The new approach

Now things are way easier! For example, if you want to add Open Graph and Twitter images on your homepage, you don't need to code anything.
Instead, you just need to **put an image (.png, .jpeg or .gif) named `opengraph-image` and/or `twitter-image`** in the same directory of the page that you want the images to be (in the example I want the images to show in the home page,
so I placed them in the same level as the `layout.tsx`).

<img alt="open graph image placement" height="680" src="/blog/add-open-graph-twitter-nextjs-app-router/open-graph-place-image.png" width="492" className="half"/>

You basically just added Open Graph and Twitter images to your page! But let's also add some metadata to it.

## Add more metadata

As said previously, the `Head` component has been removed, instead we will use the **`metadata` object
from Next.js**. You just need to create a `const` called `metadata` and export it. Eventually, you can also import the types.

``` tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: '...',
}
```

<Note>
 Take in mind that this approach is only available for Server Components and for **statically generated pages**, it won't work if the
    page is dynamically generated. In that case you need to call the `generateMetadata` function, [i will explain down below](#add-open-graph-and-twitter-images-to-dynamic-pages).
</Note>

Below there is the code that i use for my homepage, look so minimal and clean!

``` tsx
const title: string = "Ivan Smiths, Frontend UI/UX Developer from Wiesbaden";
const description: string =
"Ivan Smiths - Frontend UI/UX Developer - 3 years of experience. Seeking the limit. Currently at TD Cowen";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: title,
    description: description,
    openGraph: {
        title,
        description,
        type: "website",
        siteName: "Ivan Smiths",
        url: `https://ivansmiths.com`,
    },
    twitter: {
        title,
        description,
        card: "summary_large_image",
        creator: "@Ivansmiths",
        creatorId: "1303746727594405894",
    },
};
```

If you see the page source, you will see that this code rendered out a bunch of html tags:

``` html
<title>Ivan Smiths, Frontend UI/UX Developer from Wiesbaden</title>
<meta name="description" content="Ivan Smiths - Frontend UI/UX Developer - 3 years of experience. Seeking the limit. Currently at TD Cowen"/>
<meta property="og:title" content="Ivan Smiths, Frontend UI/UX Developer from Wiesbaden"/>
<meta property="og:description" content="Ivan Smiths - Frontend UI/UX Developer - 3 years of experience. Seeking the limit. Currently at TD Cowen"/>
<meta property="og:url" content="https://ivansmiths.com/"/>
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Ivan Smiths"/>
<meta property="og:image:type" content="image/png"/>
<meta property="og:image:width" content="2880"/>
<meta property="og:image:height" content="1558"/>
<meta property="og:image" content="http://localhost:3000/opengraph-image.png?66d44f37b83759d8"/>
<meta property="og:type" content="website"/>
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"/>
<meta name="twitter:creator" content="@Ivansmiths"/>
<meta name="twitter:creator:id" content="1303746727594405894"/>
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Ivan Smiths, Frontend UI/UX Developer from Wiesbaden"/>
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Ivan Smiths - Frontend UI/UX Developer - 3 years of experience. Seeking the limit. Currently at TD Cowen"/>
<meta name="twitter:image:type" content="image/png"/>
<meta name="twitter:image:width" content="2880"/>
<meta name="twitter:image:height" content="1558"/>
<meta name="twitter:image" content="http://localhost:3000/twitter-image.png?66d44f37b83759d8"/>
```

That's pretty convenient! As you can see, it also added `width` and `height` to both images. If you also want to add an `alt` text to the images
, you need to add a `.txt` file called respectively `opengraph-image.alt` and/or `twitter-image.alt` with the alternative text written inside.

## Add Open Graph and Twitter images to dynamic pages

Often you will end up creating pages trough dynamic routes with a `slug` or `id` used as `params` (e.g. `page.tsx` file inside a directory named [slug] or [id]).
In these cases, as previously mentioned, we need to use the `generateMetadata` function. The skeleton of the function looks
something like this:

``` tsx
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
    // the logic on how you fetch your data
  let post = getBlogPosts().find((post) => post.slug === params.slug);
})
```

The `generateMetadata` accept the `params`, which you need to fetch inside the function. In this case I am importing the function is use for fetching
the slug for each blogpost I wrote.

This is the code I use for each blogpost page:

``` tsx
type Params = {
  params: {
    slug: string;
  };
};


export async function generateMetadata({
  params,
}: Params): Promise<Metadata | undefined> {
  let post: Posts | undefined = getBlogPosts().find(
    (post) => post.slug === params.slug,
  );
    // if no posts are available return null
  if (!post) {
    return;
  }
    // destructure the properties
  let { title, publishedAt: publishedTime, excerpt, tags } = post.metadata;
    // the actual Open Graph images
  const ogImage = [
    {
      url: `https://ivansmiths.com/blog/${post.slug}/cover.png`,
      height: post.metadata.coverHeight,
      width: post.metadata.coverWidth,
      alt: title,
    },
  ];

  return {
    title,
    description: excerpt,
    openGraph: {
      title,
      description: excerpt,
      type: "article",
      authors: ["Ivan Smiths"],
      tags: tags,
      publishedTime,
      url: `https://ivansmiths.com/blog/${post.slug}`,
      images: ogImage,
    },
    twitter: {
      card: "summary_large_image",
      title,
      creator: "@Ivansmiths",
      creatorId: "1303746727594405894",
      description: excerpt,
      images: ogImage,
    },
  };
}

```

As you can see, in this case I just create a `const` called `ogImages`, where I fetch the images and its `height`, `width` and `alt` text
and used that constant as a value on each `images` key in the `openGraph` and `twitter` objects.

## Testing and validation with Vercel

If you are hosting your website in Vercel, you can actually test and validate the metadata on each deployment.
For doing this, select your 'project' in the 'dashboard', go to 'Deployments' and select the deployment that you want to test. Once
selected, you will see in the navbar on the top, the Open Graph link.

<img loading="lazy" alt="open graph image placement" height="2880" src="/blog/add-open-graph-twitter-nextjs-app-router/open-graph-testing.png" width="1442"/>

With this, you ensure that your website will look nice and clan when shared on social media.
