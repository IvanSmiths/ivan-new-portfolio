## What is Open Graph

In a nutshell: Open Graph is an internet protocol developed by Meta that enable websites to have a nicer look when shared on social media.

## Open Graph with the App router

### The old approach

The `app` router differentiate massively from the `pages` router. One of the removed feature is the `Head` component,
something that used to look like this:

``` tsx
import Head from 'next/head'

function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>My page title</title>
      </Head>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default IndexPage
```

### The new approach

Now things are way easier! For example, if you want to add Open Graph and Twitter images on your homepage, you don't need to code anything.
Instead, you just need to **put an image (.png, .jpeg or .gif) in the same directory of the `page.tsx`.**

<img alt="open graph image placement" height="680" src="/blog/add-open-graph-twitter-nextjs-app-router/open-graph-place-image.png" width="492" className="half"/>

But let's do things in order. As said previously, the `Head` component has been remove, instead we will use the **`metadata` object
from Next.js**. You just need to create a `const` called `metadata` and export it. Eventually, you can also import the types.

``` tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: '...',
}
```

<Note>
 Take in mind that this approach is only available for Server Components and for **statically generated pages**, it won't work if the
    page is dynamically generated. In that case you need to call the `generateMetadata` function, will explain later.
</Note>

Below there is the code that i use for my homepage, look so minimal and clean!

``` tsx
const title: string = "Ivan Smiths, Frontend UI/UX Developer from Wiesbaden";
const description: string =
"Ivan Smiths - Frontend UI/UX Developer - 3 years of experience. Seeking the limit. Currently at TD Cowen";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: title,
    description: description,
    openGraph: {
        title,
        description,
        type: "website",
        siteName: "Ivan Smiths",
        url: `https://ivansmiths.com`,
    },
    twitter: {
        title,
        description,
        card: "summary_large_image",
        creator: "@Ivansmiths",
        creatorId: "1303746727594405894",
    },
};
```

If you see the page source, you will see that this code rendered out a bunch of html tags:

``` html
<title>Ivan Smiths, Frontend UI/UX Developer from Wiesbaden</title>
<meta name="description" content="Ivan Smiths - Frontend UI/UX Developer - 3 years of experience. Seeking the limit. Currently at TD Cowen"/>
<meta property="og:title" content="Ivan Smiths, Frontend UI/UX Developer from Wiesbaden"/>
<meta property="og:description" content="Ivan Smiths - Frontend UI/UX Developer - 3 years of experience. Seeking the limit. Currently at TD Cowen"/>
<meta property="og:url" content="https://ivansmiths.com/"/>
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Ivan Smiths"/>
<meta property="og:image:type" content="image/png"/>
<meta property="og:image:width" content="2880"/>
<meta property="og:image:height" content="1558"/>
<meta property="og:image" content="http://localhost:3000/opengraph-image.png?66d44f37b83759d8"/>
<meta property="og:type" content="website"/>
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"/>
<meta name="twitter:creator" content="@Ivansmiths"/>
<meta name="twitter:creator:id" content="1303746727594405894"/>
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Ivan Smiths, Frontend UI/UX Developer from Wiesbaden"/>
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Ivan Smiths - Frontend UI/UX Developer - 3 years of experience. Seeking the limit. Currently at TD Cowen"/>
<meta name="twitter:image:type" content="image/png"/>
<meta name="twitter:image:width" content="2880"/>
<meta name="twitter:image:height" content="1558"/>
<meta name="twitter:image" content="http://localhost:3000/twitter-image.png?66d44f37b83759d8"/>
```

That's pretty convenient! As you can see, it also added `width` and `height`. If you also want to add an `alt` text to the images
, you need to add a `.txt` file called respectively `opengraph-image.alt` and/or `twitter-image.alt` with the alternative text written inside.
