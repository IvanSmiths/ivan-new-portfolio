With this article, we will explore various ways to center an element with CSS. We will start from the ways that make most sense,
and we will end up with some of the most crazy, useless, and over-engineered ways that I`ve discovered (some really, really cursed code awaits.).

## The flexbox way

- Target: Parent element
- Properties: `display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;`

My favourite way to center a div is to set `display: flex` property to the parent element, together with the properties `align-items: center;`
for centering vertically and `justify-content: center` for centering horizontally. The axis aligned it will be inverse if you use `flex-direction` set to `column`.

``` html
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
  <h1>Centered</h1>
</div>
```

<Draggable parent="flexbox" />

## The margin-auto way

- Target: Child element
- Property: `margin: auto`

One of the most common ways to center a div, only horizontally is to use the `margin: auto` property to the child. This will center the div only horizontally.

``` html
<div style="margin: auto;">
  <h1>Centered</h1>
</div>
```

<Draggable child="margin-auto" />

## The absolute way

The `position: absolute` property is another way to center a div. This will center the div horizontally and vertically.

``` html
<div style="position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);">
  <h1>Centered</h1>
</div>
```

## The inline-block way

The `display: inline-block` property is another way to center a div. This will center the div horizontally.

``` html
<div style="display: inline-block; margin: auto;">
  <h1>Centered</h1>
</div>
```

## The inline way

The `display: inline` property is another way to center a div. This will center the div horizontally.

``` html
<div style="display: inline; margin: auto;">
  <h1>Centered</h1>  
</div>
```

## The grid way

The `display: grid` property is another way to center a div. This will center the div horizontally and vertically.

``` html
<div style="display: grid; place-items: center;">
  <h1>Centered</h1>
</div>
```
