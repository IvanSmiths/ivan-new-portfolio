          Having begun my career as a UI/UX Designer, I spent two years in
          creating captivating digital experiences. Upon relocating to Germany,
          I transitioned into the role of a Frontend Developer, where I further
          expanded my expertise in crafting innovative web solutions. Now, in my
          current role as a UI/UX Developer, I seamlessly blend my design
          background with my development skills.
          <br />
          <br />
          Leveraging my dual expertise, I create user interfaces that not only
          prioritize aesthetics but also prioritize functionality and usability.
