# How to Add Google Analytics to Next.js Without Third-Party Packages

While it‚Äôs generally recommended to use the official [@next/third-parties](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/third-parties)
package provided by the Vercel team for integrating Google Analytics with Next.js, you might prefer to keep your `package.json`
clean and avoid unnecessary dependencies.

This guide shows you how to **implement Google Analytics** manually using the underlying logic from the **Vercel package**.
The benefit? More control, no extra dependencies ‚Äî but keep in mind, you‚Äôll need to manually track any future changes to the
official implementation (I would not expect big changes on this code).

<Note>
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads-up: Using this custom method obviously means you won‚Äôt receive automatic updates/pushes from the Vercel
  team. Check the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/third-parties)
  periodically to stay aligned and see if there are changes (again, unlikely).
</Note>

## Extracting the Google Analytics Integration Code

You‚Äôll find the Google Analytics implementation used in the official plugin in the file:
`packages/third-parties/src/google/ga.tsx`.

Here‚Äôs what the full GA implementation looks like:

<Code lang="tsx" title="packages/third-parties/src/google/ga.tsx">
  {gaSource}
</Code>

### Explanation

This code replicates what the official @next/third-parties plugin does under the hood:

- `use client`: Ensures this component runs only on the client side, which is necessary for Google Analytics since it interacts with window.
- `Script` from `next/script:` Used to dynamically load external JS and inject inline code safely while optimizing performance.
- `window['dataLayer']`: Sets up the dataLayer array that GA uses to queue events.
- `gtag()`: The function that pushes events into the data layer.
- `gtag('js', new Date())`: Initializes tracking.
- `gtag('config', 'GA-ID')`: Configures your analytics instance.
- `Debug Mode`: Optionally enables debug logs for GA in development or staging environments.
- `sendGAEvent()`: A utility to manually send custom events to GA if needed.


## A Leaner Version

If you want to simplify the GA logic and only use the essential parts for tracking, here‚Äôs a lighter version of the integration:

<Code lang="tsx" title="google-analitycs.tsx">
  {gaUsage}
</Code>

### What's Different in This Version?

- No `useEffect` hook: This version skips performance marks or other diagnostics external to Google Analytics.
- Simpler and smaller: It focuses only on GA setup with optional debug mode and no event-sending utility.
- Still fully functional: You can track page views and conversions just like in the full version.

## Integrate It in Your App Router Layout

To activate tracking across all pages, import your `google-analytics.tsx` component in `app/layout.tsx` and pass your GA ID.

<Code lang="tsx" title="layout.tsx">
  {rootLayout}
</Code>

### Why This Works
Next.js App Router renders `app/layout.tsx` on every route change unless nested layouts override it.
That means this script will persist across navigation and initialize Google Analytics once ‚Äî just like the official integration would.

**Happy tracking! üéØ**
