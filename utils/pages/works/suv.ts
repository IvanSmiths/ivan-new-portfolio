    "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum",

  metaDescription:
    "During my time at Scholz & Volkmer, I provided Next.js mentorship to colleagues, enhancing their proficiency and boosting team productivity. I streamlined legacy JavaScript by updating it to modern ECMAScript standards and integrated TypeScript with Next.js, enabling the development of robust, high-performance web applications. I also led the migration of our main website from jQuery to TypeScript, which reduced maintenance time by 40% and made the code far more reliable and scalable.",
