  metaDescription:
    "During my time at Scholz & Volkmer, I provided Next.js mentorship to colleagues, enhancing their proficiency and boosting team productivity. I streamlined legacy JavaScript by updating it to modern ECMAScript standards and integrated TypeScript with Next.js, enabling the development of robust, high-performance web applications. I also led the migration of our main website from jQuery to TypeScript, which reduced maintenance time by 40% and made the code far more reliable and scalable.",
